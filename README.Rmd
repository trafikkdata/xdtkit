# xdtkit

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of xdtkit is to make available functions for predicting AADT (annual average daily traffic) on the Norwegian road network.

## Installation

You can install the development version of xdtkit from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("trafikkdata/xdtkit")
```

## Example

The AADT modelling process requires some fairly large datasets that are not publicly available and are too large to include with the package. To show how the package should be used, we have included data from (some county).

**To come: Example of AADT-process on subset of Norway.**

Until then, code for running the full AADT model can be found in the repository [xdt-modelling](https://github.com/trafikkdata/xdt-modelling).
