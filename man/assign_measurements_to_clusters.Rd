\title{Assign Non-Barrier Measurement Links to Their Containing Cluster}
\usage{
assign_measurements_to_clusters(base_assignments, measurement_links)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_assignments}{Data frame with columns \code{id} and \code{cluster_id}
containing base cluster assignments}

\item{measurement_links}{Character vector of measurement link IDs that were
not selected as barriers}
}
\value{
Data frame subset of \code{base_assignments} containing only the
  non-barrier measurement links with columns:
  \describe{
    \item{id}{Link ID}
    \item{cluster_id}{Cluster ID}
  }
}
\description{
Identifies measurement links that were not used as barriers and assigns them
to whichever cluster they ended up in during base clustering. These links
appear only once (unlike barrier links which appear in multiple clusters).
}
\details{
Non-barrier measurements are those that:
\itemize{
  \item Have traffic volume measurements
  \item Were not selected as cluster boundaries
  \item Ended up inside a cluster after barrier removal
}
}
\note{
In the current implementation where all measurements are barriers,
  this function typically returns an empty data frame.

\dontrun{
non_barrier_measurements <- setdiff(measurement_links, selected_barriers)
measurement_assignments <- assign_measurements_to_clusters(
  base_assignments,
  non_barrier_measurements
