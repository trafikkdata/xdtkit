\title{Calculate Bus-Based AADT Estimates}
\usage{
calculate_bus_aadt(
  stops_on_traffic_links_data,
  bus_counts_data,
  year,
  cv_uncertainty = 1.06,
  location_uncertainties = c(High = 0.1, Medium = 0.2, Low = 0.3)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{stops_on_traffic_links_data}{Data frame linking bus stops to traffic links}

\item{bus_counts_data}{Data frame with bus counts by stop (columns: stopPointRef, no_of_buses)}

\item{year}{The year the data were collected}

\item{cv_uncertainty}{Coefficient of variation for count uncertainty (default: 1.06)}

\item{location_uncertainties}{The uncertainty connected to how certain we are that
the bus stop count represents the assigned traffic link.
Named vector with entries "High", "Medium", and "Low", for example c(High = 0.1, Medium = 0.2, Low = 0.3)}
}
\value{
Data frame with columns: id, stopPointRef, bus_aadt, bus_sd, stopCertainty
}
\description{
Converts bus stop counts into AADT estimates on traffic links with uncertainty.
