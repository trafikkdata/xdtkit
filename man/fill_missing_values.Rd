\title{Fill Missing Values with Multiple Imputation Strategies}
\usage{
fill_missing_values(
  df,
  unknown_impute_columns = NULL,
  mode_impute_columns = NULL,
  median_impute_columns = NULL,
  create_missing_indicators = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the variables to impute.}

\item{unknown_impute_columns}{Character vector of column names where NAs
should be replaced with the string "unknown". Typically used for
categorical variables. Default is \code{NULL} (no imputation).}

\item{mode_impute_columns}{Character vector of column names where NAs
should be replaced with the mode (most frequent value) of that column.
Default is \code{NULL} (no imputation).}

\item{median_impute_columns}{Character vector of column names where NAs
should be replaced with the median value of that column.
Default is \code{NULL} (no imputation).}

\item{create_missing_indicators}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), creates
indicator columns for median-imputed variables showing whether the original
value was missing. Column names will be "isMissing[original_column_name]".}
}
\value{
A data frame with missing values imputed according to the specified
  strategies. If \code{create_missing_indicators = TRUE}, additional indicator
  columns are added for median-imputed variables.
}
\description{
Imputes missing values in a data frame using three different strategies:
replacement with "unknown" for categorical variables, mode imputation for
discrete variables, and median imputation for continuous variables.
}
\details{
The function applies up to three imputation strategies in sequence:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Unknown imputation}: Categorical variables are filled with
    the string "unknown"
  \item \strong{Mode imputation}: Variables are filled with their mode
    (most frequent value)
  \item \strong{Median imputation}: Numeric variables are filled with their
    median value
}

Each imputation strategy is optional - only strategies with non-NULL column
specifications will be applied.

The mode is calculated excluding NA values. If all values are NA, the mode
will be NA. Similarly, median is calculated with \code{na.rm = TRUE}.

For median-imputed columns, missing indicators are created by default to
help retain information about which values were originally missing.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example: Use all three strategies
df <- data.frame(
  category = c("A", "B", NA, "A"),
  discrete = c(1, 2, NA, 1),
  continuous = c(10.5, 20.3, NA, 15.7)
)

filled_df <- fill_missing_values(
  df = df,
  unknown_impute_columns = "category",
  mode_impute_columns = "discrete",
  median_impute_columns = "continuous"
)

# Example: Median imputation without missing indicators
filled_df <- fill_missing_values(
  df = df,
  median_impute_columns = "continuous",
  create_missing_indicators = FALSE
)
}
